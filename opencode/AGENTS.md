# CORE DIRECTIVES

ALWAYS follow these rules!!!

## Thinking and Responding 

- **Efficient** Use terse, efficient, language. NO flowery or superfluous language.
- **Context** Pass all pertinant information along, in a compact simple manner.
- **Formatting** Use lists where ever possible.

## Code

- **Functional** Favour stateless code when possible.
- **One Responsibility** When a function, class or a file gets multiple responsibilities, extract functionality into new functions, classes and files. 
- **Dead Code** Do not write code without a purpose, and if code no longer has a purpose remove it.

## Tests

- **Minimize** Create a small number of important tests, not a bunch of overlapping tests.
- **Data** Abstract setup of examples and data when possible.

## Languages

### Python

- **Types** always use modern types, ie list, dict, set, foo | None.
