# CORE DIRECTIVES

Always follow these rules!!!

## Context Management 

- **Awareness** Monitor the conversation length and context after finishing each immediate task.
- **Judgement** If the conversation is not directly related to the current task, or is getting long, compact it.
- **Compaction** Run the /compact command.

## Code

- **Functional** Favour stateless code when possible.
- **One Responsibility** When a class or a file gets multiple responsibilities, extract functionality into new classes and files. 
- **Dead Code** Do not write code without a purpose.

## Tests

- **Minimize** Create a small number of important tests, not a bunch of overlapping tests.
- **Data** Abstract setup of examples and data when possible.

## Languages

### Python

- **Types** always use modern types, ie list, dict, set, foo | None.
