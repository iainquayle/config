# changes

consider removing auto close

consider moving window focus to leader ..., since it will be mainly used with plugins

add more ftplugins, even if nothing in them, just for ease of use later

## trouble

add more keybind options

change sizing of the window, needs to be larger

# additions

look into avante nvim for inline llm usage

add nvim tree
