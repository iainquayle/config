# changes

once copilot runs out, switch to huggingface/llm.nvim
supposedly get the same interface while bringing own model.
may not be as good but may as well try

## trouble

add more keybind options

change sizing of the window, needs to be larger

# additions

add nvim tree

add neogit or some other git integration
