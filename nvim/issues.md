# changes

once copilot runs out, switch to huggingface/llm.nvim
supposedly get the same interface while bringing own model.
may not be as good but may as well try

look at fuzzel for dmenu

neovim:
- add more maps to code companion, maybe add fzf support for it?
- look at mini diff, add mappings
- figure out quick fixes
- style nvimcmp windows
- figure out binding for previews for fzf and nvimcmp
- consider moving code companion binding
- consider moving nvimcmp accept to different key
- figure out good binding for terminal, as cant use leader to close it

de:
- maybe move to wayfire or niri, maybe pinnicle if it show constinued maintenance
- move to eww or astral/ags. eww probably easier to find documentation on, as well takes less setup with nix
    if move, can move fuzzy finder there
    would be nice to remove bar when not needed, could just have popover status system

- home page
- lsp file rename
- session manager (snacks or mini)
- nvim tree (neo tree)
- neogit or some other git integration (snacks lazy git, or something else)
